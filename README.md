# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Extended-For-Road-Maps
A python implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm which can be extended to determine the shortest path between two GPS locations on a road map. Provided is a text file of Cork City, which is given as input in the code. I have added two simple test functions to test it on smaller graphs too. To visualise your path, you can copy and paste the entire output (including the first line of tab-separated text) into the GPS Visualizer( https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/map_input?form=google ) text box. Before clicking 'Draw map', you should select 'Leaflet' from the Format dropdown menu on the left under General Map Parameters (because using the default Google setting give nag messages about the Maps API key)
